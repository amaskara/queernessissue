        As Princeton’s paper of record, The Daily Princetonian plays an important role in the creation and maintenance of the queer archive on campus. Unfortunately, given a history of violence toward and attempted erasure of the LGBTQ+ community, the archive of queer existence on this campus and beyond is often remarkably thin and marred by a lack of empathy for its subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This issue, entitled “Queer Remembrances, Queer Futures” argues that, before diving into the present challenges and future aspirations of the queer community, it is essential to provide space for reflections back on queer narratives of the past. In potent prose, Professor Jeff Nunokawa and Dean of the College Jill Dolan reflect on their experiences as members of the LGBTQ+ community in the 1970s, documenting the vastly different reality for the LGBTQ+ community just a couple of decades ago. Engaging with the past can inform how the queer community tackles critical issues in the present and how they imagine a future where fear of plurality is subsumed by celebration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this issue, we do just that — exploring queer students’ experiences securing housing accommodations, the power of representation offered by campus queer student-athletes Abby Meyers ’22 and Marge Donovan ’22, and a reflection on living between worlds by a queer Muslim student. Together, their stories form a snapshot of Princeton’s LGBTQ+ community today.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we are looking forward as well, challenging the design and content conventions of our paper in a digital and print product that incorporates the work of queer artists and their reflections on identity. In self-essays and profiles of LGBTQ+ students on campus like Josh Babu ’22 and Griffin Maxwell Brooks ’23, we offer a multiplicity of queer experiences that affirm the present diversity of queer voices, ushering in a future that embraces queer experiences and identities on their own terms.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We conceive of this more than anything as an invitation to the queer community on campus. An invitation can only be truly genuine when it goes beyond empty words: The content curated for this issue represents a public record — and a public commitment — to elevating the voices and stories of queer folks in our pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our sincere hope is that this marks not a one-off product, but a catalyst for continued, consistent, and abundant storytelling in the ‘Prince’ for and by members of the Princeton queer community.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>By Sam Kagen</p>

      <p>
        It’s 2 a.m. A pop-house remix of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” is playing loud enough to make your teeth chatter. And the pride of Princeton diving is plunging into a crowd of 600-odd fully vaccinated, mostly queer, and scarcely clothed partygoers in Midtown Manhattan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As tequila-powered dancers stumble through the strobe-obsessed basement venue, Griffin Maxwell Brooks ’23 literally rises above it. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7026126215715048710" target="_blank">Wearing</a> little more than an oversized white faux-fur vest and tight-fitting black leather pants, they grab hold of their necklaces (one pearl and one a Beanie Baby Dalmatian head), lean against my shoulder, and hoist themself atop a table.&nbsp;

      <p>
        Brooks is a paradox. Unapologetically queer and expressive, their larger-than-life wardrobe and personality stand out among the clean-cut khaki of Princeton, N.J. All the same, balancing a rocket scientist’s course rigor with the demands of a Division I sport are hardly the norm in New York City’s queer nightlife scene. For Brooks, life itself is a contradiction in terms, a never-ending balancing act of remarkably disparate identities.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am me,” they told me. “Queer, genderfluid, gay, all of those things, on a men’s varsity athletic team at Princeton. It’s funny, I wouldn’t call myself <em>not</em> a walking dichotomy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A junior majoring in mechanical and aerospace <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7030219001917771055" target="_blank">engineering</a>, Brooks’s ascendance to New York nightclub notoriety took hold through TikTok. The self-described “digital club kid” carved a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7030856807291686149?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">niche</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7023394729249295622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2F&amp;referer_video_id=6881419418321095942&amp;refer=embed&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">of</a> <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/bryce-hall-flaunts-10-million-net-worth-status-twitter-gets-shut">comedy</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/bimbo-reclaim-tiktok-gen-z-1092253/" target="_blank">fashion</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7040618975063231790?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">social justice</a> rooted in their queer identity, earning <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks" target="_blank">@griffinmaxwellbrooks</a> (they always go by their “government name”) over <strong>940,000 [UPDATE THIS NUMBER]</strong> followers.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Social media [is] a place where I can express my ideas and philosophies and show people my life,” explained Brooks, who identifies as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7018319959713418502" target="_blank">non-binary</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7019030424680811782" target="_blank">gay</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7020493055383964933" target="_blank">genderfluid</a>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks’s daily TikToks garner hundreds of thousands of views and offer a glimpse into their label-defying personality. Boasting a brand of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7002353183167220997" target="_blank">affirmational positivity</a>, tongue-in-cheek <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7023755529608613126" target="_blank">confidence</a>, and fiercely independent expression, they’re a digital flagbearer for Gen Z’s queer community.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Brooks’s public persona appears effortless and easy-going, their stature as a young, queer public figure often invites challenging private conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        “My DMs are full of people saying ‘you helped me figure out that I’m non-binary, you helped me figure out that I’m gay or that I’m this, that I’m that, or just helped me be more comfortable in my own body,’” they said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Does that weigh on you?” I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        “A little bit. I think that the part of it that’s a compliment seriously outweighs the worry.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What’s the worry?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “The worry [is] that I’m steering people wrong, but I’ve never felt like I’m steering people wrong. The notion that I’m steering people wrong only ever comes out of the mouths of people whose perspective on queer people may be not the most politically correct,” they responded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks expanded their persona beyond the internet in the summer of 2021, launching into queer nightlife and quickly becoming a regular at Manhattan <a href="https://www.papermag.com/on-top-is-back-2021-2653481337.html?rebelltitem=11#rebelltitem11" target="_blank">parties</a> thrown by the legendary event producer <a href="http://www.susannebartsch.com/about" target="_blank">Susanne Bartsch</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        “[When] the summer hit, TikTok started to merge with real life because people were going outside again,” Brooks said. But once the vaccine came out, “it dawned on me that I did have fans, that it wasn’t just a number of faceless people on the internet commenting. I’d go out to parties, and nightclubs, or just to Washington Square Park and people would be like ‘You’re the kid from TikTok.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think a lot of people think [Princeton] is the world,” they continued. “I don’t. It gets suffocating, when you treat it like the world … so I leave.”
      </p>
      <h1>
        ‘Confidence is just a made up word’
      </h1>
      <p>
        Typically “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7020809394791222534" target="_blank">escaping</a>” to Manhattan as often as three nights a week, Brooks has lived the overwhelming majority of their life in suburban New Jersey. They grew up just an hour north of Princeton in sleepy Berkeley Heights, a community Brooks calls “semi-conservative.” At home, they often faced rampant homophobia.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Senior year, me and Griffin and all of the other queer people sat together, literally separated from the rest of our classmates,” explained Monica Martinez, Brooks’s friend and high school classmate. “I saw firsthand how Griffin was ostracized. They were bullied by people, often left out of things, and just the dynamic of the school [was that] people didn’t really talk about it, they didn’t really recognize it as ‘Oh, you’re being homophobic.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        Years removed from the days of high school bullying, Brooks now derives strength and value from their queer identity. They identified changes in their mentality as a key reason for their radical shift.
      </p>
      <p>
        “A lot of my mindset is very ‘fake it till you make it,’” they explained. “Confidence is just a made up word for you to use to describe when you stop caring what people think. So just stop. Just go out and do your thing and don’t look at the eyes of people who look at you. That’s how I want to be so that’s how I am.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And while the Princeton is a wholesale improvement upon Berkeley Heights, Brooks noted, the school is often a difficult place for queer students.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Dec. 13, 2021, they made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7041368983894920495" target="_blank">TikTok</a> stating just that. “My name is Griffin Maxwell Brooks,” they said, “and as a queer, and gender nonconforming person, I often feel unvalued, unwelcome, and sometimes unsafe here at Princeton University. Have a good night.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In an interview, they elaborated on the substantial disconnect between Princeton and New York, specifically with regard to queer spaces and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Queer is an identity that encapsulates a culture,” they said, “and there is not a lot of that culture at Princeton. We’re very different. When I meet somebody in New York and they hear about [Princeton], they make a face. They’re like ‘You’re a what now? You go to Princeton?’ or they’re like ‘What is that?’”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        I mentioned to Brooks that the University has a considerable gay population, with over 25 percent of first-year undergraduates <a href="https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/frosh-survey-25/demographics.html" target="_blank">identifying</a> as LGBTQ+. They didn’t quite buy it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s a difference between being gay and being queer,” they said. “Princeton might be gay but it isn’t very queer.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks’ claim isn’t hard to verify. The revealing white crop top and hot pink sunglasses they wore to our interview are easy to spot amidst a sea of sweatpants and loose hoodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        “People [at Princeton] look at me and think ‘What the hell?’” they explained. “But any press is good press. I like the way I look. There’s nothing offensive about the way I look or dress or act. So I know that when people are taken aback by it, it either comes from ignorance, surprise, or admiration.”
      </p>
      <h1>
        ‘Some might say camp’
      </h1>
      <p>
        “How would you describe the way you dress?” I asked.

      <p>
        “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7036735656646724911?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">Eclectic</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7034592757033504047?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1]" target="_blank">flashy</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7034286075308821806?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">over</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7033816385897663790?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7031960149036420399?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">top</a>,” they responded. “Some might say <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190503-what-does-it-mean-to-be-camp" target="_blank">camp</a>.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Juan Hermo ’23, Brooks’s roommate, sees the way Brooks dresses and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7031641405290450223?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">speaks</a> as a necessary form of representation.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t wanna say ‘walk around and be a stereotype,’ but that’s what we do,” Hermo said. “We <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7032787824696888623?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">walk</a> around, we use the gay words, we <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7037574791272041774?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">dress</a> the gay way, and if you don’t, then they forget you exist and it’s all the easier to erase you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks’s attire may be too outlandish to erase. Their TikTok account features countless videos of them getting dressed in the morning, styling tight-fitting corsets and towering high-heel boots alongside cropped knit sweaters and shoulder-length earrings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their unconventional mix of sheer and skin is par for the course in Midtown. Nobody notices jewelry featuring a pair of miniature swords next to a man covered head-to-toe in intricately painted cheetah spots wearing only gold briefs and a lady toting five pounds of denim on her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The way you fit in at a Susanne Bartsch event is by standing out,” Brooks told me in Manhattan, gesturing to a woman coated in green paint sporting gold panties, star-shaped pasties, and thigh-high black rubber boots. “People dress like [it’s Halloween] literally whenever we want.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “<a href="http://www.susannebartsch.com/" target="_blank">Bartschland</a>” is a world unto itself. Born in Switzerland, Bartsch rose to prominence as a tastemaker after moving to New York City in 1981. She helped <a href="https://people.com/movies/rupaul-susanne-bartsch-on-top-documentary/" target="_blank">expand</a> followings for now-prominent designers like Vivienne Westwood and Marc Jacobs; <a href="http://www.susannebartsch.com/press/2018/3/21/rupaul-praises-queen-of-the-night-susanne-bartsch-you-gave-me-my-big-break" target="_blank">launched</a> the career of drag megastar RuPaul; and hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4hydU_nS78" target="_blank">parties</a> at the legendary <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/05/26/copacabana-is-gone-after-80-years/" target="_blank">Copacabana</a>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7022746924428119302" target="_blank">event</a> I attended alongside Brooks — one in a series of Bartschland spectacles — was a practicum in garish absurdity. Located at Sony Hall in the basement of the Paramount Hotel, the event featured outrageous costumes and began with a burlesque show which included, among other things:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lolavonrox/?hl=en" target="_blank">Lola von Rox</a> stripping naked and covering herself in spray paint before pulling a chain out of her vagina;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.pissy-pussy.com/about" target="_blank">Pissy Pussy</a> parading around on stage in a sparkling red skin-tight bodysuit and makeup ala Jim Carrey’s “The Mask” to the tune of “Mr. Saxobeat;”
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.julieatlasmuz.com/" target="_blank">Julie Atlas Muz</a> appearing seemingly out of nowhere in a black thong and copious amounts of body glitter before encapsulating herself in a large, clear silicone bubble;
      </p>
      <p>
        And <a href="https://www.laszlomajor.com/" target="_blank">László Major</a> twirling around a precariously mounted silver firehouse pole, displaying bedazzled nipples through an overwhelming display of strobe lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Brooks, this is all more or less standard for a Bartsch party. Her regular crowd ranges from queer royalty to nervous students, but the events are open to anybody with $45 and the desire to <a href="http://www.susannebartsch.com/upcoming-events" target="_blank">buy a ticket</a>.&nbsp;
      </p>

        Seeking to expand her digital presence, last year Bartsch hired Brooks to run her TikTok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bartschsusanne?lang=en" target="_blank">account</a>. The influencer was tasked with utilizing their extensive savvy to further build the Bartsch brand.

        ‘My space to be me’
      </h1>
      <p>
        For those who know Brooks, Bartsch’s interest was of little surprise. At once charming and charismatic, Brooks’s magnetic personality affords them an ever-present and constantly-growing harem as we weave through the dance floor. They’re a modern socialite and a consummate people person — everybody seems to want to speak to them and they seem to want to speak to everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The way that Griffin can read a room and make every single person in that room feel as though they belong there is such a gift,” said Topaz Winters ’23, Brooks’s close friend. “I can, and routinely do, talk to them for hours about love and sex and life and gender. They’re such a delight.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Gender is little more than a foreign, far-off idea in Bartschland. The space’s abundant queerness and unrelenting dress both embraces the extremities of gender expression and eradicates the concept completely.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “How do you think about gender in a space like this?” I asked Brooks after watching a drag queen adorned in lace shred a rock ballad.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t,” they replied. “It’s all either non-existent or super exaggerated.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Murray <a href="https://mistershowbiz.com" target="_blank">Hill</a>, a drag king comedian who hosted the event, put it best.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “You’re wondering,” Hill said to a seemingly perplexed audience member, “is that a man or a woman? The answer, sir, is ‘no!’ And in case you were wondering, my pronouns are yabba/dabba/doo!”
      </p>
      <p>
        With regard to gender, Brooks lives simply as they please: dressing and behaving without so much as a passing consideration for assigned norms. <a href="https://goprincetontigers.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/griffin-brooks/18823" target="_blank">Exemplified</a> by the dramatic eyeliner and pearl jewelry in which they chose to be photographed for their Princeton Athletics profile, it’s difficult to overstate Brooks’s fervent rejection of norms.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7020140529287433477" target="_blank">Diving</a>, and the abundant responsibilities that accompany Division I varsity athletics, is also a notable <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7038239906514275631" target="_blank">component</a> of Brooks’s life — and a sizable time commitment in and of itself. When their team was not holding workouts during the summer of 2021, they continued training regularly on their own, going to great lengths to stay in form.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I dove for the summer, like four days out of the week,” they said. “It was a two-hour long practice but I had to get on my electric longboard and go from [Lower Manhattan] up to Grand Central, the safety of which I will not comment on … and then I’d get on the train and take it to Greenwich, Connecticut. It was the closest pool that would have me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You would take the train an hour to Greenwich just to dive?” I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When things were shut down, there weren’t indoor pools that were open to the public,” they explained. “The places in New Jersey where I could practice were Princeton and potentially Rutgers. Rutgers, they said no, and Princeton said no unless you were in the testing protocol. And NYU said no. The only place I could find was the YMCA in Greenwich, Connecticut.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Do you ever get tired?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sometimes. When I do, I have some coffee, or a Red Bull. But typically, I run on straight fumes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, supplementing the fumes, Brooks feels <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/6984226721679592709?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">supported</a> by their teammates and even somewhat at home among athletes on campus.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “Diving is much more queer than swimming and lots of other competitive sports,” Brooks said. “I fit in with the divers. The dive team has other queer presences.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the nature of varsity athletics is one which <a href="https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=library_faculty" target="_blank">can</a> <a href="https://www.justiceatwork.com/resources/2016/july/lgbt-athletes-still-experience-harassment-and-di" target="_blank">often</a> <a href="https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4397&amp;context=etd" target="_blank">be</a> <a href="https://globalsportmatters.com/youth/2018/11/27/lgbtq-student-athletes-risk-mental-health-when-joining-a-sport/" target="_blank">inhospitable</a> to LGBTQ+ students, even in ostensibly liberal and accepting spaces.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m the most presentationally queer on my team,” Brooks continued. “It’s difficult … [people] stray away from me because of it. I think that being remotely feminine is an instant no-no for homosocial fraternal spaces like a men’s athletic team.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly detached from Brooks’s Manhattan presence is their love of engineering — a drive they’ve honed since they matriculated, alongside Martinez, at Union County Magnet High School, a small application-based public <a href="https://www.ucvts.tec.nj.us/Page/755" target="_blank">school</a> for STEM students.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Everybody was insanely smart,” said Martinez, referencing the institution’s engineering magnet status.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Brooks, that aptitude continued right through college.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “They are wildly smart,” said Winters. “That kid knows numbers and engineering like nobody else … I make fun of Griffin because I think they work too much and if you know me, people think I work too much. They worry so much about stuff like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7024221978701712645" target="_blank">grades</a>, stuff like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7016547131007716613?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">classes</a> and, not a lot of people know that about them.”

      <p class = "caption">

      </p>
      <p>
        “My brain is very STEM-oriented,” Brooks said, “so my mind is kind of like a bulleted list. I’m going to do this, then I’m going to go here, then I’m going to do that and then I’m going to go to bed. And then I’m going to wake up, sometimes two hours later, and do it all again.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks’s STEM work often surprises their Manhattan acquaintances.
      </p>
      <p>
        “[People] usually ask me ‘What do you do?’” Brooks said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “‘I’m a student.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Oh, where do you go to school?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Oh, Princeton.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Oh, that’s far.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Yeah, I have a car.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Oh, okay.’
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, ‘what do you major in?’
      </p>
      <p>
        And then I usually say ‘you’ll never guess.’
      </p>
      <p>
        And they’re like ‘I don’t know. Philosophy? Psychology?’
      </p>
      <p>
        And I’m like ‘mechanical engineering.’
      </p>
      <p>
        And they’re like ‘You’re right, I would not have guessed that.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        At first glance, Brooks’s pursuits may appear confoundingly disparate. Yet, as with most things in their life, Brooks exudes a sense of cool control about the chaos — to them, honing a smorgasbord of passions comes naturally.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        “They all work together in a non-tangible way,” they said of their various interests. “They all play together, in a really weird way. I think the way my brain works is conducive to all of these things, it just so happens that all of them are wildly unrelated.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s unclear which of Brooks’s many talents will continue with them after school. But, despite the excitement about life beyond University classrooms, they remain committed to their engineering aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I [may] never become an engineer; that’s very possible,” they said. “I definitely think it’s likely that I do [though]. I think it’ll be in an interesting capacity. I might do, you know, 10 years of being a socialite and then I’m like ‘okay, time to be an engineer.’”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        At 3:30 a.m., Bartsch’s crowd is left weary and depleted. Though Brooks hasn’t sat down since we arrived over seven hours ago, the rest of the venue had tired, shrinking to no more than 150 people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks told me they didn’t want to leave. But they had assignments and practice and a whole host of other obligations, likely due to begin in a matter of hours. So we piled into “Karen the Stallion,” their white 2014 BMW X3, and headed home. We arrived on campus at 5:20 a.m.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How do you do it?” I asked them. “How do you stay up all night two or three times a week and not absolutely die?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I love it. You have to love it. I lived a whole second day in that space,” they replied. “I do it because I have to — it’s my space to be me.”

      <h1 data-splitting>    <strong>The Daily Princetonian:</strong> How would you describe your coaching style?</h1>
      <p>    <strong>Carla Berube:</strong> I’m competitive and demanding, but I also think I’m an educator. My coaching is a lot of teaching the game. I hope I’m a good motivator, and I want to see all of my players be the best versions of themselves and have them feeling really confident and strong as competitors, but also as individuals off the court as well. So I think I’m kind of a player’s coach where yes, I’m coaching the game of basketball, but also, I’m hopefully someone that they can come to and talk about everything that is happening in their roles off the court, as well as on.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1 data-splitting> <strong>DP:</strong> What type of environment do you aim to foster among your players?&nbsp;</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>CB:</strong> Just an inclusive environment where everybody has a voice and the ability to be who they are. It’s important for us to recognize, support, and celebrate everybody, whatever backgrounds they come from or how they identify. I hopefully am fostering and cultivating a really open team, where everybody can be themselves and feel like we’re all in this together.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <h1 data-splitting><strong>DP:</strong> What has been the most difficult aspect of coaching?&nbsp;</h1>

      <p> <strong>CB:</strong> As a coach, you’re just so invested in each individual, and when you see them going through difficult times, you want to be there for them as much as they want. Throughout my career, there’ve been some tough times, but I wouldn’t trade this job for anything. I think one of the best pieces is that you can have an impact on 18 to 22-year-olds every year. And it’s a cycle; you get them for four years and then you see them move on, but you don’t lose that contact. It’s a pretty rewarding profession to watch them grow, spread their wings, and fly. There are many hard times, but all the great times certainly outweigh the tough ones.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1 data-splitting><strong>DP:</strong> What has been your proudest moment as a coach?&nbsp;</h1>


      <p><strong>CB:</strong> I’ve had quite a few proud moments here at Princeton already. I was also at Tufts University for 17 years. I think that one of the things that I’m most proud of is that players, when they leave, either at Tufts or Princeton, still feel very connected to their experience here and to their teammates. It’s really important that my players have a great experience during their time in my programs and when they walk away from college, they’re not walking away from the family they made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <br>
      <p> Also, I was really proud of my team this year making it to the [NCAA Tournament] Round of 32, and how resilient they were. It certainly was challenging at the beginning of the year when we hadn’t played together for 18 months, but with every day we took steps forward and came together, got better, and just kept building throughout the season. It just seemed like everybody was together, whether they were playing a lot on the floor or they were on the bench during games. Those bench players were so vital during practices to get us ready, and it just seemed like a really cohesive unit. It made the run that we had just so much fun, and I was just really proud of everyone.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1 data-splitting>DP:</strong> How did it feel to win the Ivy League and make it all the way to the Round of 32 in March Madness?&nbsp;</h1>

      <p><strong>CB:</strong> It was just a really fun, amazing journey for this team. Every season is different because there are different players and different leaders, but I just thought this group really came together and developed the chemistry that successful teams need. Watching that just grow throughout the year, into the Ivy League Tournament and those two games in the NCAA Tournament, was phenomenal. It was a great run, and I’ve had a couple of weeks now to reflect on what a tremendous ride it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h1 data-splitting>DP:</strong> What impact, if any, would you say your identity has had in shaping your career?&nbsp;</h1>

      <p>CB:</strong> Certainly when I was a player in the mid-90s, my lifestyle and how I identified was much more of a secret. It was tough at that time to be who I was. I think during my time coaching at Tufts I really got more comfortable and shared who I was. Then, when I met my wife, it just made sense to open that door to my personal life with my team. And certainly when I was having children, I wanted my family at Tufts to know my family, outside of my profession. For me to connect with my players, I need to know them on a personal basis, and if I’m not open to them, they’re not going to be open to me. So I just opened the door, and it felt really comfortable to be who I was.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1 data-splitting>DP:</strong> Has your personal identity influenced your perspective on your role as a coach?&nbsp;</h1>

      <p>CB:</strong> I hope that my players have felt like they could be who they are, if I’m doing that same thing. I put it in my bio so that recruits know that this is who I am, and I certainly talk about my family a lot, my wife and three kids.&nbsp;</p>
      <br>
      <p>I think becoming a mother certainly changed me as a coach. I think I’ve just become a little more calm and it puts it much more in perspective. You know, I’m coaching people’s daughters, so you just think about it in a different way, and it’s made me a better coach, having my own children.&nbsp;</p>
      <br>
      <p>So I don’t know exactly how me being out and open has affected everybody, but I hope it just makes my players and prospective student-athletes feel comfortable here.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1 data-splitting>DP:</strong> Are there any specific people that have helped you feel empowered and comfortable being open with your identity?&nbsp;</h1>

      <p>CB:</strong> At first, I had colleagues at Tufts who just made it feel really comfortable and OK and open. It’s now been maybe 13 years since I put it in my bio, and never once have I felt like that was a mistake or gotten negative feedback about it. I don’t know if there was anybody specifically that encouraged me to do it, but I just thought it was time to be who I am and that maybe it could impact others in a positive way to feel comfortable being who they are.</p>

      <h1 class = "headline">Josh Babu ’22 researches the effects of gender-affirming care on transgender youth’s long-term health</h1>
      <p>By Sejal Goud</p>
      <p>
        <em>This article is the first installment in a series that explores one of Princeton’s most distinct academic traditions: the requirement of junior and senior independent work for nearly all undergraduate students. As thousands of students conduct and present unique research every year, these Features articles shed light on the inspiration, the outcomes, and everything in between.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>For Josh Babu ’22, a pre-med concentrator in the Department of Molecular Biology and Rhodes Scholar, a certificate in Gender and Sexuality Studies (GSS) might not seem like the most obvious choice. Far from it, his studies in the GSS department actually led him to the topic of his senior thesis.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“When I started to focus on GSS a little bit more and look into queer and trans health specifically, that’s when I found a real true passion and felt driven,” Babu explained. “So I would say the GSS certificate program was actually pretty instrumental in my career aspirations.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Princeton’s GSS Department enables undergraduate students seeking a certificate in the department to explore the intersection of GSS with interests in their home department, ultimately creating a diverse array of research avenues for student independent work.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Babu is certainly taking advantage of this opportunity. His experience in the GSS department, he says, guided him to research on gender-affirming healthcare, now the subject of his senior thesis.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>This passion led Babu to pursue research on transgender healthcare with clinical support from Princeton and the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. He studies biological markers of stress in transitioning youth, contributing to the literature on the psychological effects of gender-affirming care.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Gender-affirming care, according to the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, is a model of healthcare that validates patients’ diverse gender identities.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Babu’s research looks at the effect of gender-affirming care on the degradation of telomeres, or protective regions of repetitive sequences at the ends of chromosomes. As telomeres degrade and shorten, they limit the ability of the chromosome to replicate without losing critical DNA, essentially counting down the life of a cell.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Chronic stress in individuals has been shown to increase the rate of telomere degradation, so telomeres can serve as a biological marker of stress. According to the American Psychological Association, “a number of studies have linked stress with shorter telomeres, a chromosome component that's been associated with cellular aging and risk for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Stress is a particularly important element of transgender medicine, as numerous studies have documented that transgender and nonbinary teenagers experience anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at much higher rates than their cisgender counterparts.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Though the research group has not completed their data analysis, Babu explained that he expects “to find an increase in the activity of the protein that regulates telomere extension” among patients who received gender-affirming care. In other words, Babu anticipates results that indicate gender-affirming care prevents accelerated rate of telomere degradation due to stress in trans youth.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“If gender-affirming care can help with that and make [telomere degradation] less severe,” Babu said, “then that’s also really important to know and will help healthcare providers and policymakers make more informed decisions about gender-affirming care for kids specifically.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>His research goes beyond telomere analysis. With this senior thesis and beyond, he hopes to pave the way for future studies of trans health and to provide a framework for navigating some of the challenges he has faced along the way.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“My goal is to build a methodology and infrastructure for studying trans health in general. And that means establishing a roadmap for future researchers so that they know how to deal with big institutions and how to apply for grant funding in a way that will make them successful and how to establish credibility as a researcher in the trans community,” Babu said.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Babu noted that this kind of medical research has not always prioritized the well-being of transgender individuals.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“There’s an extremely unfortunate history of trans people being tested on and treated like lab rats,” Babu said. “And it’s important we combat that.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Babu’s research is informed by first-hand experience.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“I’m gay myself, and I have had experiences in healthcare that were subpar at best. And I understand that, especially in the place I grew up, there weren’t a lot of doctors who understood the needs of queer patients,” Babu explained.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“While that’s less common now, and less common across the United States, it is far more common for physicians not to be familiar with issues dealing with trans patients. So that’s something that I really felt pushed to help improve,” he continued.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>While conducting his research, Babu grappled with his role in the queer community as a cis researcher in the context of historical tensions between gay and trans members of the LGBTQ+ community.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“There’s something to be said about leaving intellectual work about a community of people to the community itself. With that being said, I do think my experience in the LGBTQ+ community is relevant, but not necessarily parallel at all,” Babu said.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“In fact, I think the experiences are wildly different in most scenarios,” he continued. “But being a part of the LGBTQ+ community has made me appreciate and understand how important it is to have an alliance across the full spectrum of the queer and trans community.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Babu emphasized the importance of direct involvement with the trans kids in his study, so as not to assume he knows what is best for an entire community.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“I sat down with [a transgender youth] and their family and asked them, ‘What kind of research do you want to see? What kind of research do you think will be helpful to you?’ And this was at the very early stages of the study, before we had established a research design or even applied for grants,” he said.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Applying for these grants eventually became one of Babu’s greatest challenges. Babu recognized that many of the obstacles to his research have come in the form of systemic institutional barriers as opposed to outright rejection of advancing trans health. In particular, he noted the complexity of navigating funding from small nonprofits aimed at LGBTQ+ research versus larger organizations who may consider it less urgent than other biomedical research.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“If you approach individuals at these [large] institutions and propose a study like mine, their initial response might be ‘Oh, that sounds great. That’s very important socially, yes, we support.’ But then when you get down to it, and you actually want to apply for money at the institutional level, they generally don’t put their money where their mouth is,” Babu said.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“That’s just been a general trend in the field of trans health research, but it’s not true across the board. We were able to get funding pretty easily from the NIH [National Institutes of Health], but I think that was a unique case,” he continued.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>The support he has received over the course of his thesis work isn’t only financial.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>His advisor Dan Notterman, Professor of the Practice in Molecular Biology and one of few practicing physicians among Princeton’s faculty, has guided him through this process, even though the field of transgender healthcare is largely new to him. Notterman noted that his medical training did not adequately cover gender diversity.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“Physicians my age didn’t have training in gender and sexuality aside from training in disorders of sexual differentiation,” Notterman said.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Notterman stressed the importance of continual learning about gender diversity by reading and allowing other professors at Princeton to shape his biology lectures on these topics.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“I have to say, though, that it has been mainly my students who teach me this,” Notterman noted, in reference to students like Babu.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>As Babu prepares to continue his education in medicine and healthcare policy at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, Gillian Hilscher ’23 will build on Babu’s research with Notterman’s guidance in the coming year. Hilscher is also a pre-med concentrator in the Department of Molecular Biology, pursuing certificates in GSS and Neuroscience.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Hilscher did not originally intend to study GSS. She was first introduced to the field through her first-year Writing Seminar, The Politics of Intimacy, taught by Professor Alexander Davis. Then, in her junior year, Babu presented his senior thesis research to one of Hilscher’s classes, piquing her interest as a way to combine the study of gender and sexuality with her biology focus.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>To date, she has outlined her research proposal in her Junior Paper and will work to extend previous research in the field by examining the blood samples of trans youth for changes in gene expression as a result of outside influences, a branch of biology known as epigenetics. Specifically, Hilscher will study DNA methylation and epigenetic age as further biological markers in relation to gender-affirming care.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>“I couldn’t imagine not having this aspect of education [in GSS]. Especially as a pre-med [student], I think that it’s very important to have these perspectives,” Hilscher said. “These are the people you’ll be serving.”</em>
